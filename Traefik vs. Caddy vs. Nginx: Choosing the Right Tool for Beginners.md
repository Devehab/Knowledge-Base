## 🎯 **Recommendations Based on Specific Constraints**

If you:
- Have no fixed public IP (using dynamic DNS)
- Have blocked ports 80 and 443
- Want to avoid tunnels (like Cloudflare Tunnel)

Here’s how each tool stacks up:

### **1️⃣ Best Option: Caddy**
- Handles dynamic DNS smoothly.
- Easy DNS Challenge setup to get SSL certificates even if ports 80/443 are blocked.

#### **Example Setup with Caddy:**
```plaintext
example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
    tls {
        dns cloudflare YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
    }
}
```

### **2️⃣ Great Alternative: Traefik**
- Flexible and powerful with a bit more complexity.

#### **Example Traefik Configuration:**
```yaml
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
  websecure:
    address: ":443"

certificatesResolvers:
  cloudflare:
    acme:
      email: your-email@example.com
      storage: acme.json
      dnsChallenge:
        provider: cloudflare
```

### **3️⃣ Less Ideal: Nginx**
- Manual setup and not beginner-friendly under these conditions.

#### **Example Setup with Nginx & Certbot:**
```bash
certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials ~/.secrets/cf.ini -d example.com
```
