## What Are LLM Agents?

An **agent** in the context of Large Language Models is a system designed to perform specific tasks by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs. Think of an agent as an intelligent assistant powered by AI, which can perform tasks ranging from simple workflows to complex problem-solving.

There are two main categories:
- **Workflows**: Step-by-step, predefined actions (like following a recipe 📝).
- **Agents**: Dynamic systems that make decisions as they operate (like a chef improvising in the kitchen 👨‍🍳).

In this guide, we'll discuss both types under the umbrella term **"agentic systems"**.

## When Should You Use Agents?

Before building an agent, consider whether you really need one. Here's how to decide:

- **Simple tasks**: Stick to straightforward LLM prompts for simplicity and speed.
- **Complex tasks**: Choose agents when your problem requires flexibility, complex decision-making, or dynamic tool usage.

| Use Case                                       | Best Approach                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Clearly defined, predictable tasks             | Workflows (for consistency)      |
| Flexible tasks needing real-time decisions     | Agents (for complexity handling) |
| Basic, single-step queries                     | Optimized single LLM prompts     |

## When and How to Use Frameworks

Frameworks can simplify agent creation but come with their own complexities. Popular frameworks include:
- LangGraph (LangChain)
- Amazon Bedrock AI Agent
- Rivet
- Vellum

These tools can handle tasks such as:
- Interacting with LLMs
- Using external tools or APIs
- Linking multiple LLM operations

However, frameworks can also obscure the underlying processes. To maintain clarity:
- **Start directly with APIs** to understand basic concepts clearly.
- **Use frameworks judiciously**, always inspecting generated code to ensure you understand how everything works.

## Core Building Blocks of Agents

Let's dive into the essential building blocks you’ll need to create effective agentic systems:

### Augmented LLMs

An augmented LLM is an LLM enhanced with additional functionalities:

1. **Retrieval** 🔍: Access current information from external sources (e.g., web searches).
    - *Example*: Getting the current Bitcoin price from an API.

2. **Tools** 🛠️: Execute specific actions through external programs (calculators, code runners).
    - *Example*: Performing mathematical operations accurately using a calculator tool.

3. **Memory** 💾: Remember and reference past interactions, providing consistent responses.
    - *Example*: Remembering earlier conversation context (like the city "Paris") for relevant follow-ups.

Think of augmented LLMs as giving your AI assistant superpowers 🦸.

### Workflows Explained

#### Prompt Chaining 🔗

Break down tasks into sequential LLM calls.
- Ideal for tasks easily divided into clear steps.
- Example: Writing a summary, then translating it into another language.

#### Routing 🚦

Directs input to specialized LLM workflows based on task categories.
- Ideal when handling diverse input types.
- Example: Routing customer queries to sales, support, or billing.

#### Parallelization 🧩

Run multiple LLM tasks simultaneously for efficiency and accuracy.
- **Sectioning**: Different LLMs perform separate tasks concurrently.
- **Voting**: Multiple LLMs provide different outputs combined for consensus.

- Example (Sectioning): One LLM analyzes content while another checks appropriateness.
- Example (Voting): Multiple LLMs check code for vulnerabilities simultaneously.

#### Orchestrator-Workers 🎼

A primary LLM orchestrates smaller tasks assigned to multiple specialized worker LLMs.
- Ideal for complex, unpredictable tasks.
- Example: An orchestrator assigns different file edits to specialized coding agents.

#### Evaluator-Optimizer 🔄

One LLM generates output; another evaluates and refines until ideal results are achieved.
- Useful when iterative feedback significantly improves results.
- Example: Refining translations until they meet desired quality standards.

## Creating Autonomous Agents 🤖

Autonomous agents independently:
- Plan and execute complex instructions.
- Use tools reliably.
- Manage tasks and recover from errors.
- Operate autonomously with minimal human intervention.

Suitable for open-ended tasks or long-term operations:
- Example: AI coding assistant independently fixing software bugs.

## Conclusion 🏁

When building effective LLM agents:
- Start with simplicity and build up only when needed.
- Clearly understand each component of your agentic system.
- Always prioritize clarity, transparency, and simplicity.
