## 🧐 What Are Rate Limits?

**Rate Limits** are rules set by Let's Encrypt to control how many certificates users can create within a certain timeframe. These rules ensure everyone can access the service fairly and prevent abuse or server overload.

## 📌 Main Let's Encrypt Rate Limits Explained

Here's an easy-to-follow breakdown of the main rate limits:

### ✅ Certificates per Registered Domain
- **Limit**: Up to **50 certificates per registered domain every 7 days**.
- **Example**: If you own `example.com`, you can issue a maximum of 50 certificates per week, including subdomains like `sub.example.com` or `www.example.com`.

*Note*: A registered domain refers to the main domain (e.g., `example.com`). Subdomains are considered part of the same registered domain.

### ✅ New Orders per Account
- **Limit**: Up to **300 new certificate requests every 3 hours per account**.
- **Example**: Each request for a certificate counts as a new order. Frequent requests using automation tools (like Caddy or Certbot) could hit this limit if you don't reuse certificates.

### ✅ Failed Challenges per Domain
- **Limit**: Up to **5 failed domain verification challenges per registered domain every hour**.
- **Example**: If you repeatedly fail DNS or HTTP verification, you will be temporarily blocked from requesting new certificates for one hour.

### ✅ Names per Certificate
- **Limit**: Each certificate can include **up to 100 domain names**.
- **Example**: You can cover multiple domains like `example.com`, `www.example.com`, and various subdomains within one certificate, up to 100 domains in total.

## 💡 Are These Limits Enough?

Yes, these limits are usually more than sufficient for regular users. Here's why:

- **Weekly Limit (50 certificates)**:
  - You can use wildcard certificates (like `*.example.com`) to cover multiple subdomains in just one certificate.

- **Automatic Renewal**:
  - Certificates expire every **90 days**, but renewals do not count against your weekly limit.
  - Tools such as Caddy automatically handle renewals.

- **Multiple Accounts**:
  - Generally unnecessary but available as a backup option for unique situations.

## 🔧 How to Handle Rate Limits

If you reach a limit, here's what you can do:

### ✅ Use Wildcard Certificates
- A wildcard (`*.example.com`) certificate covers all subdomains.
- This significantly reduces the number of certificates needed.
- Wildcards require DNS verification, easily managed by services like Cloudflare.

### ✅ Manage Certificates Effectively
- Reuse existing certificates whenever possible.
- Automation tools like Caddy or Certbot help manage and renew certificates efficiently.

### ✅ Review Logs
- Check logs if limits seem unclear to identify the cause.

## 📚 Practical Examples

### 🔹 Example 1: Many Subdomains
- If you have one main domain (`example.com`) and 50 subdomains (`sub1.example.com`, `sub2.example.com`, etc.), issue one wildcard certificate (`*.example.com`) instead of multiple separate certificates.
- This approach uses only one of your allowed weekly certificates!

### 🔹 Example 2: Automatic Renewal (Caddy)
- Using Caddy? It automatically renews certificates.
- Automatic renewals **don't count** towards your rate limits.

## 🎯 Conclusion

To summarize:

- Let's Encrypt uses rate limits for fair usage.
- Main limits include:
  - **50 certificates per domain per week**.
  - **300 new certificate requests per account every 3 hours**.
  - **5 failed verification attempts per domain per hour**.
- These limits are adequate for most scenarios.
- Manage limits with wildcard certificates and automatic renewals.
