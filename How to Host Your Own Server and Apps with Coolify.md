## Introduction
Hosting your own apps might sound challenging, but Coolify makes the process intuitive and beginner-friendly. With this guide, you'll quickly learn how to host multiple applications and manage your infrastructure effortlessly.

## 🤔 What is Coolify?
Coolify is a simple yet powerful tool that lets you host apps, databases, automation services, and more on your own server. It simplifies complex tasks, like SSL certificate setup, DNS configuration, and database management.

---

## ✅ What You’ll Need
- A Virtual Private Server (VPS) from Hetzner
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system
- Domain name with DNS management access
- SSH key for secure login (explained below)

---

## 🖥️ Step 1: Creating Your Server on Hetzner
Follow these simple steps:

1. Visit [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) and sign up.
2. Create a new server:
   - Choose **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.
   - Recommended: 2GB RAM, 160GB storage (about $33/month).
   - Name your server clearly for easy management.

### 🔐 Setting Up SSH Keys
SSH keys securely log you into your server without passwords:

- Generate a key (if you haven't):
```bash
ssh-keygen
```
- Copy your public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
- Paste this public key into your Hetzner server settings.

---

## 🔥 Step 2: Configuring the Firewall
Your server needs a firewall for security. Open these ports:
- **80** (for HTTP)
- **443** (for HTTPS)
- **8000** (default for Coolify)

Assign this firewall configuration to your server.

---

## 💻 Step 3: Installing Coolify
Connect to your server via SSH (open your terminal):

```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
```

Run these commands to update the system and install Coolify:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
bash <(curl -s https://coolify.io/install.sh)
```

After installation, access Coolify:
```
https://your-server-ip:8000
```

Create your account to access the Coolify dashboard.

---

## 🌐 Step 3: DNS Configuration
Proper DNS setup ensures your server and apps are easily accessible:

- Go to your domain provider (like Namecheap).
- Create a DNS record pointing to your server IP, e.g., `services.yourdomain.com`.
- Optional: Create a wildcard DNS record (`*.services.yourdomain.com`) for automatic SSL and subdomain creation.
