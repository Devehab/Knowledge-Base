## 💡 What is Self-Hosting?

Self-hosting means running your applications on your own servers instead of relying on third-party platforms. This approach provides:

✅ **Greater Control** – Configure your deployments and resources exactly as needed.
✅ **Cost Savings** – Avoid expensive subscription fees for managed services.
✅ **Data Privacy** – Keep sensitive data within your infrastructure.
✅ **Flexibility** – Choose the tools and configurations that work best for your project.

Self-hosting requires some technical knowledge but is highly rewarding in terms of control and security.
